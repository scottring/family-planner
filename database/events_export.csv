If it is in error, please contact your provider by portal or by calling (301) 970-4001, extension 6 to access the dial-by-name directory for all of our providers. You have received an invitation for a telehealth session using our secure and encrypted platform.  By accepting the invitation, or joining the online session, you are consenting to treatment in this manner. If you do not attend the session at the agreed upon time, or there is a technology failure, your provider will attempt to contact you via the primary phone number listed in your record. In case of an emergency, your provider may contact local law enforcement for a wellness check, or call 911 to your location. By accepting this invitation you are also certifying that you are located in Maryland, unless you and your provider have previously discussed an alternative location. Please inform your provider if there are other people in your vicinity, as healthcare is 1:1 unless previously discussed and agreed upon. Our office has been closely monitoring the rapidly changing landscape of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic. In accordance with the guidance from the State of Maryland, World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) we have decided to transition our services to Telehealth beginning Sunday, 3/16/2020, and continuing until further notice. What this means for you... 1. Your care will continue via a HIPAA compliant Telehealth platform, Microsoft Teams. 2. To ensure that you can be contacted to schedule your appointment, please provide your current primary email address and current primary telephone number to your provider via a portal message. 3. You must use the video option in order for the visit to be considered reimbursable by your insurance. Telephone calls, while at times helpful and at your prerogative, are not reimbursable. Speak with your provider if you need clarification. 4. If you have any difficulty accessing the appointment, please contact your provider directly using our dial by name directory - (301) 970-4001, ext 6. 5. Please portal message the Patient Experience Team (PET) for any administrative questions or concerns.

Dear Scott,

Please accept this invitation for the virtual visit on Microsoft Teams.

If you cannot make it to your appointment, please provide two (2) business days' (weekends and holidays excluded) notice to avoid paying a no-show/late cancellation fee. You may use the appointment scheduler feature on the portal, or you can call the office at 301-970-4001, option 2 to speak with a scheduler. If you are more than 15 minutes late to an appointment, I will assume that you are not able to make it and will close out the appointment.

Sincerely,

Dr. Smith (she/they)
