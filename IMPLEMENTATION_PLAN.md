# Family Planner - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the existing family planner into a simplified, focused tool for daily family coordination. Remove complexity, focus on immediate needs (this week), and ensure both parents stay synchronized.

## Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues & Simplify (Priority 1)
**Goal:** Get the app working reliably with simplified navigation

### 1.1 Dashboard Redesign
- [ ] Replace current complex Dashboard with focused daily view

- [ ] Fix any remaining API endpoint issues
- [ ] Clean up unused complex components

### 1.3 Simplify Event System
- [ ] Add notes field to events for quick reminders

## Phase 2: Core Family Features (Priority 2)
**Goal:** Build the essential coordination features

  - Bedtime routine
  - School prep
  - Weekend chores
- [ ] Allow conditional checklist items based on day

### 2.2 Weekly Planning Interface
- [ ] Create dedicated planning view with 3 sections:
  1. Review last week (mark complete or defer)
  2. Process inbox items
  3. Assign this week's responsibilities
- [ ] Add bulk actions for quick processing
- [ ] Show conflict detection prominently

### 2.3 Partner Synchronization
- [ ] Add "assigned to" field on all events/reminders
- [ ] Create "Today's Handoffs" view showing who does what
- [ ] Add simple notifications for new assignments
- [ ] Create shared notes area for quick communication

## Phase 3: Polish & Optimize (Priority 3)
**Goal:** Make the app delightful to use daily

### 3.1 Smart Features Enhancement
- [ ] Improve voice note parsing for better event creation
- [ ] Enhance Smart Event Coordinator with family patterns
- [ ] Add weather integration for outdoor events
- [ ] Optimize packing list suggestions

### 3.2 Mobile Optimization

- [ ] Add quick checklist checking

### 3.3 Data & Testing
- [ ] Add data export/backup
- [ ] Create onboarding flow for new families
- [ ] Add family member profiles (kids, parents)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all workflows

## Technical Debt to Address

### Backend
- [ ] Consolidate event and task models (tasks become events with checklists)
- [ ] Add proper recurring event support
- [ ] Add real-time sync via WebSockets
- [ ] Improve database schema for simpler queries

### Frontend
- [ ] Remove complex unused components
- [ ] Simplify state management
- [ ] Improve loading states
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries

## Components to Remove/Simplify
- **Remove:** Complex task management, goal tracking, project features
- **Simplify:** Dashboard to focus on daily view
- **Merge:** Tasks into events with checklists
- **Keep:** Voice notes, Smart Event Coordinator, calendar, inbox

## Success Metrics
1. Morning check takes < 30 seconds
2. Voice note to event < 3 taps
3. Both parents see updates within 1 minute
4. Weekly planning session < 15 minutes
5. Zero "I thought you were handling that" incidents

## Implementation Order
1. **Week 1:** Fix critical issues (Phase 1.1-1.2)
2. **Week 2:** Simplify event system (Phase 1.3) & Add recurring events (Phase 2.1)
3. **Week 3:** Build weekly planning (Phase 2.2)
4. **Week 4:** Add partner sync (Phase 2.3)
5. **Week 5-6:** Polish and optimize (Phase 3)

## Key Principles
- **Simplicity First:** If it takes more than 2 taps, it's too complex
- **This Week Focus:** No long-term planning features
- **Clear Ownership:** Every item shows who's responsible
- **Voice First:** Capture thoughts quickly, organize later
- **Family Patterns:** Recognize and adapt to YOUR family's routines
