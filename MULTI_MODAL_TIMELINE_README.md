- width ≤ 1024px: Tablet Dashboard  
- width > 1024px: Desktop Timeline
```

### Manual Override
Force specific views with URL parameters:
- `?mode=mobile` - Force mobile view
- `?mode=tablet` - Force tablet dashboard
- `?mode=watch` - Force watch view
- `?mode=desktop` - Force desktop timeline

## Voice Commands

### Supported Commands
- **"What's next?"** - Get next upcoming task
- **"How are we doing?"** - Progress and status check
- **"Mark [task] as complete"** - Complete specific task
- **"How much time until [event]?"** - Time remaining
- **"List all tasks"** - Hear upcoming tasks

### Voice API Endpoints
- `POST /api/voice-timeline/query/:eventId` - Process voice queries
- `POST /api/voice-timeline/action/:eventId` - Execute voice actions
- `GET /api/voice-timeline/timeline/:eventId/voice` - Voice-optimized data

## PWA Features

### Offline Functionality
- **Service Worker** caches timeline data automatically
- **Background sync** when connection restored  
- **Local storage fallback** for offline access
- **Network-first** strategy for fresh data when online

### Installation

- **Connection status** indicators on all interfaces
- **Automatic reconnection** when network restored

### Multi-Device Sync
```javascript
// All interfaces sync immediately when tasks are completed
socket.emit('timeline-updated', {
  eventId: event.id,
  completedTasks: updatedTasks,
  updatedBy: deviceId
});
```

## Usage Examples

### Kitchen Workflow
1. **Tablet Dashboard** mounted on kitchen wall shows full timeline
2. **Mobile phone** for quick updates while moving around
3. **Voice commands** for hands-free operation while cooking
4. **Smart watch** for glanceable reminders during prep

### Family Coordination
1. **Parents** use desktop/tablet for planning and oversight
2. **Kids** use mobile for their assigned tasks
3. **Voice assistant** provides status updates to family
4. **Watch notifications** for time-sensitive reminders

## Technical Architecture

### Client-Side Components
- React components with device-specific optimization
- Service Worker for offline and PWA functionality
- WebSocket client for real-time updates
- Web Speech API for voice integration

### Server-Side APIs

- Voice command processing with NLP patterns
- WebSocket server for real-time synchronization
- Database persistence with MongoDB

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  eventId: "event_123",
  timeline: [
    {
      activity: "Start cooking pasta",
      time: "2024-01-15T17:30:00Z",
      duration: 15,
      type: "meal",
      voiceFriendly: "Start cooking pasta"
    }
  ],
  completedTasks: [0, 2, 5],
  deviceAdaptations: {
    mobile: { collapsed: false },
    tablet: { fullscreen: true },
    watch: { viewMode: "next" }
  }
}
```
